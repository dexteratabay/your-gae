			<h1>WHAT IS BASEBALL?</h1>
			<h2>Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two opposing 
			teams who take turns batting and fielding. The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team, 
			called the pitcher, throws a ball which a player on the batting team tries to hit with a bat. 
			The objectives of the offensive team (batting team) are to hit the ball into the field of play, 
			and to run the basesâ€”having its runners advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what 
			are called "runs". The objective of the defensive team (fielding team) is to prevent batters from 
			becoming runners, and to prevent runners' advance around the bases. A run is scored when a runner
			legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate (the place where the player started 
			as a batter). The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game is the winner.</h2>
